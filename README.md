## What Is This?

This repo will contain my study notes and code as I work through [*Writing an Interpreter in Go*](https://interpreterbook.com/) by [Thorsten Ball](https://twitter.com/thorstenball).

## Why Am I Doing This?

I'm interested in programming languages as tools that are designed, created, maintained, and improved. 

My goals are to:
- Learn more about interpreters
- Improve my Go

Because I'm interested in natural languages as well, I'd like to play with various approaches to syntax.

At the start of this project, most of what I know about interpreters came from helping [Anthony Shaw](https://twitter.com/anthonypjshaw) write [CPython Internals: Your Guide to the Python 3 Interpreter](https://www.amazon.ca/CPython-Internals-Guide-Python-Interpreter/dp/1775093344) while I was running the curriculum at [Real Python](https://realpython.com/team/jjablonski/).

## How Can You Use This?

You can read through these study notes and see the code for each section:
