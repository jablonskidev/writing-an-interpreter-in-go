## 1.1 Lexical Analysis

You'll change the representation of your source code twice before you evaluate it:

Source code → Tokens → Abstract Syntax Tree

Here's what happens in each of the two steps:

- **Source code → Tokens:** Turning **source code** into **tokens** is called **lexical analysis** or **lexing**. This transformation is done by a **lexer**, which is sometimes called a **tokenizer** or a **scanner**, even though there are subtle differences between the terms.

- **Tokens → Abstract Syntax Tree:** The **tokens** are small data structures that are easy to categorize. They're fed to a **parser**, which turns them into an **Abstract Syntax Tree**.
